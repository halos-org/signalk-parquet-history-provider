/**
 * Measuring a process that does not stay still long enough to be sampled.
 *
 * The rest of this harness measures a running subject: settle, then equal
 * windows, differencing counters for rates. A roll lives between one and
 * fifteen seconds, has no steady state, and its whole cost is a transient —
 * so none of that applies, and the subject is gone before a window closes.
 *
 * What is left is the kernel's own high-water mark. `VmHWM` is a maximum the
 * kernel already tracked, not an instantaneous reading, so a poll every few
 * milliseconds cannot miss a peak that happened between two polls — only one
 * that happens after the last poll and before the process exits. That window
 * is why the measured process is asked to report its own figure as well: when
 * it does, that number is exact and the polled one is kept beside it as a
 * cross-check.
