/**
 * Queries, from the side that must never hold an engine.
 *
 * This file runs inside the Signal K process, so it starts `query/main.js` and
 * reads what it prints. Nothing here imports `@duckdb/node-api`, and
 * `src/test/plugin-import-graph.test.ts` is what keeps it that way — a lazily
 * loaded engine inside a request handler is exactly the shape this design
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * **One process, kept.** Starting an engine costs ~345 ms on the device and a
 * query costs 39–141 ms, so a process per query spent six times more on
 * starting than on answering. The price is memory the query process does not
 * give back; recycling it is
 * [halos-org/halos#178](https://github.com/halos-org/halos/issues/178).
 *
 * **One request, one statement.** The sibling provider issues a query per
 * pathSpec and a second for non-numeric paths. Here a request naming ten paths
 * compiles to one statement, which matters more now that the statement is most
 * of what a query costs.
