/**
 * The query process.
 *
 * One of these runs for as long as the plugin does, and it answers every
 * history query. It is a separate process rather than part of the server
 * because `@duckdb/node-api` maps a ~100 MB native addon and DuckDB's
 * allocator does not return what a query allocates — neither belongs in a
 * process that also serves the vessel's data.
 *
 * It stays alive because starting it is ~345 ms on the device, against 39–141
 * ms for the queries themselves. What that costs is memory the process never
 * gives back: it settles at the high-water mark of the largest query it has
 * served. Recycling it is
 * [halos-org/halos#178](https://github.com/halos-org/halos/issues/178).
 *
 *   node dist/query/main.js --data-dir <path> [--memory-limit 256MB]
 *
 * Requests are one JSON object per line on stdin, answered in order. Each
 * answer is newline-delimited JSON on stdout: one array per row, then one
 * object summarising the request — rows are arrays and the summary is an
 * object, so the two need no marker to be told apart. The summary carries back
 * the request's `id`, which is what lets the caller tell an answer from the
 * answer to something else after a restart.
 *
 * It exits 0 at end of input, and 1 if the engine cannot be started at all. A
 * failed query is an answer, not an exit: one bad request must not cost every
 * later one its warm engine.
