 * playback at all, `streamHistory` is the playback, and `getHistory` is what
 * `/signalk/v1/snapshot/` builds a full tree from. These assert the contract a
 * client sees — the shape of a replayed name, what a snapshot holds for a path
 * that went quiet, and where the snapshot's stated bound cuts it off.
