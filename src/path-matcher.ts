// Glob matching for the per-delta hot path.
//
// The filter and throttle checks run on EVERY incoming delta — 100+/s on a
// busy vessel. Calling minimatch(path, pattern) per pattern per delta parses
// and compiles the glob into a RegExp every single time. With a real filter
// list from the field (89 patterns) that measured ~874µs per delta, i.e. ~87%
// of one core at 100 deltas/s, which pinned Node's event loop at 100% CPU and
// starved everything else in the server.
//
// Three things fix it, in increasing order of payoff:
//   1. Exact patterns (no glob metacharacters) go in a Set — most real filter
//      lists are mostly literals, and a Set hit is O(1) with no regex at all.
//   2. Real globs are compiled to Minimatch objects ONCE, at construction.
//   3. Results are memoized per path. Signal K paths are a small, stable set
//      that repeats forever, so after the first delta of each path the answer
//      is a single Map lookup.
