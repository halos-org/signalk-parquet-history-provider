 *
 * One streaming `COPY` per UTC date, never `PARTITION_BY`. A partitioned
 * write's peak rises with the row count and runs out of memory at this
 * package's path cardinality; a plain `COPY` streams and stays near 150 MB at
 * 1.27M rows. Measured in `docs/layout-decision.md`.

 * timestamp names, so a roll spanning midnight writes two files and both are
 * correct.
