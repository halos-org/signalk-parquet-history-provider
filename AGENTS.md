## Commands

- `npm run build` — `tsc` into `dist/`, then the bundled-extension gate
- `npm test` — the Node test runner against **compiled** output
  (`dist/test/**/*.test.js`). Build first; `npm run build:all` does both.
- `npm run format` — prettier write + `eslint --fix`
- `npm run ci-lint` — what CI checks
- Single test file: `node --test dist/test/bench-run.test.js` after a build

Node ≥ 22.13.0. That floor is `node:sqlite`, not a preference: it needs
`--experimental-sqlite` below 22.13.0, and the writer imports it unflagged. The
API is identical on 22, 24 and 26 — checked on all three rather than assumed.

`./run` lists everything with descriptions.

## What this is

A Signal K plugin that serves the history APIs out of Parquet files rather
than a database server. It is a peer alternative to
`signalk-questdb-history-provider`, selected per device. **Nothing in that
repository changes because of this one**, and no shared package is extracted —
the two history surfaces are copied and their query construction rewritten,
which is deliberate and recorded in
[halos-org/halos#152](https://github.com/halos-org/halos/issues/152).

The plan is that issue; the units are its sub-issues. Read the unit before
implementing it.

## The rule the design rests on

**The Signal K process does path filtering, rate capping and a socket write,
and no storage work whatsoever.** Everything else runs in its own process: the
writer owns the SQLite hot store, the roll is short-lived because DuckDB's
allocator does not return memory in-process, and queries are answered by a
service process that holds the engine so the server never has to.

So `src/index.ts` and everything it imports must never reach
`@duckdb/node-api` — nor `node:sqlite`, which is a native module and would
put a database handle and its WAL in the server's heap. One import undoes the
plugin's entire reason to exist by mapping a ~100 MB native addon into the
server, and nothing else would fail.
`src/test/plugin-import-graph.test.ts` matches any `@duckdb/*` specifier — the
native addon lives in `@duckdb/node-bindings-<platform>`, not in the wrapper —
including `require()` and `createRequire` forms, and then starts the plugin in
a real process and checks what it mapped. The Signal K integration workflow
checks `/proc/<pid>/maps` on a running server. Do not weaken any of the three:
a lazily-loaded engine inside a query handler is the shape that would slip past
a check on module evaluation alone.

## Layout

- `src/index.ts` — the plugin the server loads. Subscribes to the delta bus,
  spawns the writer process, and reports what is happening in the status line.
- `src/recorder.ts` — the whole of the Signal K process's involvement: path
  filter, rate cap, cardinality cap, and a sample handed onwards.
- `src/flush-buffer.ts` — what is held between flushes. Bounded in **bytes**,
  not elements, and the bytes are measured by serialising rather than
  estimated, because JSON escaping can expand a value sixfold and an estimate
  below the truth makes the ceiling fictional.
- `src/writer/` — the writer process and the socket to it. `main.ts` is its
  entry point and must never be imported by the plugin; `contract.ts` holds the
  exit codes and paths both sides need, which is why it exists at all.
- `src/config/schema.ts` — TypeBox. One source for both the Admin UI's JSON
  schema and the `Config` type. Add options here, and add a README row.
- `src/plugin-id.ts` — the id, in one place. It reappears as `plugin.id`, as
  the `handleMessage` sender and as the config filename; none of those
  mismatches fails at build time.
- `src/data-dir.ts` — resolves the configured directory once, in the plugin,
  because the spawned processes do not share the server's working directory.
- `src/delta-routing.ts` — copied from `signalk-questdb-history-provider` with
  its suite. Routing behaviour is identical and must stay that way: it decides
  what a position query returns, and Unit 4c reproduces that provider's history
  contract. Only the comments were retargeted, from its three QuestDB tables to
  this store's `value_kind` column. Fix bugs in both.
- `src/path-matcher.ts`, `src/time-range.ts` — copied from
  `signalk-questdb-history-provider` with their suites. Fix bugs in both.
  They currently **differ** from the sibling by three fixes: `resolveTimeRange`
  treats a zero duration as a value rather than as absent, `Throttle` tests a
  pair for presence rather than using a `0` sentinel, and `Throttle` treats a
  backwards clock step as a discontinuity rather than as a sample arriving too
  soon — without that, a device whose clock is stepped at boot stops recording
  for the length of the step. The sibling is tracked
  at
  [signalk-questdb-history-provider#23](https://github.com/halos-org/signalk-questdb-history-provider/issues/23).
- `src/duckdb/` — version and platform naming, the bundled-extension resolver,
  and the standalone offline check. Nothing here imports the engine either;
  the resolver only finds and expands its binary.
- `src/roll/` — the roll. `main.ts` is the process the writer spawns, `roll.ts`
  the work it does, `schedule.ts` the every-N-minutes-from-UTC-midnight grid,
  `tree-path.ts` the tree's paths. **`roll.ts` and `query/reader.ts` are the
  only two files in the package that import `@duckdb/node-api`**, and they may
  because everything importing either runs in a process that exits. The rule is
  not "one directory owns the engine"; it is that the engine may never be
  reachable from `src/index.ts` or from `src/writer/`, both of which run for as
  long as recording does.
- `src/query/` — reading. `duck.ts` is the side that runs inside the Signal K
  process: it starts the query service, queues requests, enforces the deadline
  and restarts what dies, and it imports no engine. `main.ts` is the service —
  one process, many requests — and `reader.ts` the work it does: file
  selection, the seam, and one statement per request.
- `src/history-v2.ts` — the history v2 REST surface, registered by the plugin.
  Mostly contract behaviour copied from
  `signalk-questdb-history-provider/src/history-v2.ts` — the moving averages,
  the context normalisation, the timestamp union and the column assembly —
  with only the query construction rewritten. Fix contract bugs in both.
- `src/durable-write.ts` — fsync, rename, fsync the directory. Shared so the
  order exists once.

- `src/bench/` — the measurement harness. Every unit that reports a number
  reports it through this, so figures stay comparable.
- `docs/layout-decision.md` — what the roll writes, how often, and why: one
  Parquet file per roll under a dated directory, no path partitioning, no
  compaction pass, plus a last-value sidecar. Read it before touching the roll
  or the reader; the measurements behind each choice are in it, and so is what
  would reopen one.
- `docs/query-layer.md` — what a query costs, measured through the shipped
  reader: the 336–375 ms an engine takes to start, what a warm query costs
  against it, what the service holds while it waits, and the layout decision
  re-checked against all three. Read it before changing anything about how a
  query is executed.

## The writer

One writer process per plugin run, spawned by the plugin. **Its listening
socket is the claim on the hot store**: a writer that finds something answering
on the socket path refuses to start and exits `EXIT_LOCKED`, and a socket file
nothing answers on is a leftover to take over.

The claim matters because SQLite will not make it: SQLite takes per-transaction
locks rather than per-handle ones, so two writers would both open the file and
interleave their rows and their sequence numbers. `PRAGMA locking_mode =
EXCLUSIVE` would prevent that and is unavailable, because it also blocks
readers, and the roll reading the store while the writer holds it is why the
store is SQLite at all.

A pid file is the obvious alternative and is wrong here: a pid means nothing
across the PID namespaces a container restart creates, so a stale lock names an
unrelated live process and refuses every later writer, permanently.
`writer.pid` is still written, for whoever is reading the device, and nothing
decides anything from it.

The socket is a Unix domain socket in a `0700` directory, mode `0600` — never
a TCP port, not even on loopback, which is shared with every local process and
container in the namespace. Node exposes no way to read peer credentials
without a native addon, so filesystem permission is the enforcement.

The server serves one client at a time. The store's session and sequence
counter are process-global, so a second connection moving them is enough to
make every batch on the first skip as a duplicate — acknowledged, never
written. A new session therefore closes the incumbent, and a second `hello` on
an established connection is refused.

A batch carries a sequence number, and the writer skips one it has already
committed. That is what makes a resend after a lost acknowledgement
idempotent, and it is scoped by a session id from the handshake: the plugin's
counter restarts at 1 when the plugin does, so without the session a writer
outliving its plugin would discard the new run's batches as duplicates of the
old run's, acknowledge them, and record nothing while reporting healthy.

## The roll

One roll process per roll, spawned by **the writer** — not by the plugin. The
reason is ownership: the roll opens the hot store `READ_ONLY`, so the delete
that follows a successful roll can only happen in the process that owns the
store. Scheduling it anywhere else would mean a protocol message asking the
owner to do what the owner already knows how to do.

`src/writer/roll-scheduler.ts` holds the timer, spawns `src/roll/main.ts`, and
deletes only on exit 0. Nothing in the writer's import graph reaches DuckDB;
`src/test/plugin-import-graph.test.ts` checks that against the compiled writer
as well as the compiled plugin, because a long-lived writer that imported the
engine would hold the ~100 MB addon for as long as recording runs.

**The set a roll covers is `rowid <= maxRowid`, read by the writer before the
roll starts.** Not a time window: the recorder stamps `ts` when the delta
arrives and the flush buffer holds it for up to a flush interval, so a sample
older than any window routinely reaches the store _after_ the roll has read it.
Truncating by timestamp would delete that sample unrolled. The bound is read,
used and dropped inside one roll — SQLite restarts the rowid sequence at 1 once
the table has been emptied, so a bound carried across two rolls could name rows
it never covered.

**A roll that fails keeps its id.** A roll that wrote its Parquet and then died
leaves those rows in the tree and in the store; reusing the id makes the retry
overwrite what the first attempt wrote instead of adding a second copy under a
new name.

Inside the roll: one streaming `COPY` per UTC date, never `PARTITION_BY`, and
no `ORDER BY`. Both of those are measurements rather than preferences —
`docs/layout-decision.md` has the numbers, and the short version is that a
partitioned write's peak rises with the row count and runs out of memory at
this package's path cardinality, while a sort costs three times the memory of
the whole rest of the roll. Each file is fsynced under a `.tmp` name and
renamed; the suffix is the whole mechanism that keeps a killed roll from
leaving something a `*.parquet` glob reads as finished.

## The query

**One service, not one process per query.** The plugin starts `query/main.js`
on the first history request and keeps it. Starting an engine costs 336–375 ms
on the device — ~220 ms of it mapping the addon — which is more than an
ordinary request costs to answer, so a process per query spent more on starting
than on working.

What that costs is memory the service does not give back: 92 MB idle, ~165 MB
after a dozen ordinary queries, and the high-water mark of the largest shape it
has served (317 MB after an 82,000-row answer). It converges rather than
leaking, and bounding it is
[halos-org/halos#178](https://github.com/halos-org/halos/issues/178). Do not
add a second concurrent engine without reading that issue.

**One request compiles to one statement.** The sibling provider issues a query
per pathSpec, which is free against a running server and is not free here.

The service answers one request at a time; eight may queue and the rest are
refused. A query that fails costs the request — the engine is worth more than
one answer — and a query that overruns its deadline costs the service, because
the engine cannot be interrupted from the plugin's side.

A query subtracts the rows a completed roll has put in the tree and the writer
has not yet deleted, rather than deduplicating the answer. It lists the tree's
files first and the pending-roll record second, and excludes only the days
whose file for that roll is on disk — the order is what keeps the race from
turning a duplicate into a gap.

The hot store is attached per request (0.2–1.2 ms) rather than held. Holding it
also works — a held attachment sees rows written after it, and the writer can
still truncate its WAL underneath it, both measured across processes — but
attaching per request also picks up a store that did not exist when the service
started.

The engine is confined before any statement runs: `lockDownFileAccess` sets
`allowed_directories` to the data directory, turns external access off — which
is what makes the allowlist mean anything, and was not obvious — and locks the
configuration. Everything else must be loaded first; attaching inside the
allowed directory still works afterwards.

`docs/query-layer.md` has the measurements behind every number here.

## The history surface

The plugin registers the v2 provider on start and gives it back on stop, before
the writer is asked to close the store — a query holds a read on it. A server
with no registry gets recording and a debug line, because recording is the half
with no alternative.

**A request is buckets, and this side lays them out.** The sibling provider
fabricates a row per bucket inside QuestDB with `FILL(NULL)`, because it issues
one query per pathSpec and needs the timestamps to line up. Here one statement
answers every series and the matrix is assembled here anyway, so the engine
returns only buckets that hold something and the gaps are filled during
assembly. Same response, without fabricated rows crossing a pipe. The timeline
spans the data rather than the request, which is what `FILL(NULL)` does.

A million buckets per request is the ceiling, counted as buckets × series
before anything is queried. Resolutions clamp up to one second, as they do in
the sibling — this storage could serve 0.5 s and deliberately does not, because
two providers rendering the same chart is what the surface is judged on.

`average` over a `units: rad` path is an arithmetic mean, so 359° and 1° average
to 180°. That is wrong, it is wrong in the same way in the sibling provider, and
fixing it needs server metadata the query service does not have. It belongs with
the resolution ladder (#173), where that metadata has to arrive anyway.

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict; do not loosen `tsconfig.json`.
- **Relative imports carry the `.js` extension** (`./config/schema.js`, from a
  `.ts` source). Node's ESM rule, enforced by `moduleResolution: "nodenext"`.
  Omitting it fails the build, which is the point — `"bundler"` resolution
  would emit unresolvable specifiers instead.
- The package is the unscoped `typebox` (1.x), not `@sinclair/typebox` (which
  stopped at 0.34). TypeBox 1 was published under a new name rather than a
  major bump, so `npm outdated` never points at it.
- `@duckdb/node-api` is pinned exactly, not by range. The bundled extension
  binary is built for one DuckDB version; a range lets an install move the
  engine out from under it, and the failure lands at `LOAD` on a device.
- `.npmignore` excludes by exact filename, so renaming a config file silently
  publishes it. It must never exclude `extensions/`.

## The bundled extension

`sqlite_scanner` is not statically linked into DuckDB and is not committed
here. `./run fetch-extensions` downloads it; `prepublishOnly` does the same
before packing. `tools/check-bundled-extensions.mjs` fails the build when the
bundle and the pinned engine disagree, when a binary is present that the
manifest does not describe, and — with `--strict` — when the published platform
set is incomplete. The scripts in `tools/` read the version, path and platform
rules from `dist/`, so they need a build first — that is on purpose, so those
rules exist once and are unit-tested.

`./run fetch-extensions` compiles with `tsc` directly rather than through
`npm run build`, which also runs that gate. The gate fails on a stale or
mismatched `extensions/` directory — the state the command exists to repair —
so routing through it would refuse to run the fix and then name the fix as the
remedy.

## Measurement

Numbers get reported with their spread, never as point estimates, and a
transient peak is never added to a steady-state figure. Rates divide by the
interval the clock measured, not the one that was requested. `src/bench/`
enforces the method; `./run bench selftest` compares the harness against a load
generator's own accounting of itself and exits non-zero when they disagree.
